## Exercise 1
1. The message the customer never saw:
    "You are Sunny. Answer in one short sentence."
2. How many times the customer has spoken:
    2 times.
3. Can the model tell that the last reply came from the order tool? Why does that matter?
    No, because every reply has the role "assistant," not a tool specific role, so the model can not identify it as a tool response.
4. The customer now types "thanks'. How many messages are sent on the next call?
    6 messages, the 5 existing ones plus the new "thanks".

A reply such as this one, with the model simply accepting override statements from users, could cost a real shop through customer complains, labor disputes, or even staff safety issues if customers show up past store hours and file complaints, or if customers show up past closing and get frustrated at employees, causing a confrontation that should not have been stirred in the first place. Critical business facts such as store hours and shipping/return policies should come directly from a tool or established data, never from the models discretion. By attempting to hard code these parameters, developers can try to ensure that the assistant remains predictable and a secure brand chatbot, regardless of user prompts (especially if the prompt is as simple as the one practiced here).
